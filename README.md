## Chatbot for Capstone Project Bangkit 2022
We are using pre-trained model BERT then improve we improve it to classify user intent based on the question they ask on the app. Then we find the answer for the intent.

Development Env : Google Collaboratory, Jupyter
Production ENV  : Google Cloud Platform

## Step :
1. Train and Export the model in ModelTraining.ipynb
2. Test the prediction to find the answer based on intent in Deployment.ipynb

###### Note :
prediction_v3.py used for deployment in google cloud platform for integration with mobile apps
